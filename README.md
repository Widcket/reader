A little Bottle app I made back in 2013 for a coding contest. Still works. Kinda.

## What it does
Straight from the docstring:
```
This little app was made for Programmr's "News Reader 2013" contest.
What it tries to do is to present the top 3 news from CNN, ABC and NBC that belong to a a set of
shared/common topics between these 3 news sites, ordered by occurrences (number of news of each topic).
Works by fetching the Top Stories feeds from CNN, ABC and NBC, stripping some common words from the titles,
then filtering the title words that are most common in the 3 feeds, selecting the top 3 topics,
then picking a random new item from each topic and displaying the result.
```
